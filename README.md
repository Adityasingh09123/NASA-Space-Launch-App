Nasa space launch app is used to schedule launches to habitable exoplanets.The data for the exoplanets is taken from https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/data.html.

There is a upcoming section which lists all the future launches.We can abort future launches and remove them from upcoming section.
